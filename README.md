# D12-s-Cafe

Simple web site created for a coffee shop (not real, that's why i named it "D12's café"). 

The entire project was coded with HTML, CSS and Javascript (no wordpress or anything else that creates it automatically). 

Below, i will give some short introduction for each page, even though i will upload the pdf document, but it's in Albanian. 

1. First page - simple introduction with the café, a cover photo, buttons on top of the page so user navigates in the other pages(make an order, live music, see the menu and historical info), then some short info about the place, then a short animation of pictures that shows the products, and in the end text info about opening times, contact and location.

2. Order page ("rezervo"), 4 columns that each of them contains radio buttons with the products and extras the user may select, (1st column, size of the cup, 2nd column,  main product, 3rd column,  any extras, 4th, name and phone number (but not necessary)). After user submits his order, he clicks the "next" button so it shows a simple receipt of his choices, then, he may collect the order physically in the shop.
  
3. Live Music - just a simple page with 2 buttons, "play- pause" button, which triggers a audio file to play and spot once clicked again, and a "back" button to bring the user to the first page.
     
4. Menu - tabel structured page which contains all the products. 4 columns, (1st is the number of the product, 2nd is the name, 3rd price and 4th a star-based rating for each product). Also 2 buttons, to go back and one to make an oreder directly from the menu page.
        
5. Info - a page that shows some history about the place and some photos.
           
These are the main pages of my work, this project has a lot more to improve, so i would be happy to work on a similar one and make it better than that.
           
This website doesn't have a domain address so it's stored in html, css amd javascript files.
